        <p>
          LuLaRoe offers budget-friendly, comfortable, fashion-forward
          clothing in all sizes and for all body types. LuLaroe offers
          many styles for women, as well as a few kids and mens styles.
        </p>
        <p>
          What makes LuLaRoe so unique? Only 5,000 of each print is
          produced across all styles and sizes - so the item you
          choose is very unique to you!
        </p>
        <p>
          The clothing is sold only by independent LuLaRoe fashion
          consultants at their online or in person pop up parties.
          Talk to anyone who owns LuLaRoe and they will tell you what
          the hype is all about! You may have heard about the "buttery
          soft" leggings - which are amazing! But all of the styles are
          comfortable and perfect for dressing up or down. LuLaRoe is
          perfect for everyday life!

          <p>
            Welcome to the Team LuLa Queens page!
            We are Dicia Marguccio & Erica Stoltz of Team LuLaSisters,
            the original members of Team LuLa Queens!
            We are sister-in-laws who fell in love with LuLaRoe
            as customers & decided to bless othersâ€™ lives by
            becoming fashion consultants in June 2016. Dicia lives
            in Windber, PA & Erica lives in Columbia, MD. Together,
            we work to spread the LuLa love across state lines.
            LuLaRoe has been a huge blessing in our lives & in the
            lives of many families.
